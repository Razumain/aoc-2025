This is not the most optimal way to solve Andent of Code problems. But for us Spring Boot lovers,
it is the most fun way!

Just implement the solution class of the day. Everything is served with input. Input storage etc.

To use this, create a fork, or copy the files locally.
Set the base location in the application.yml file to a place where your input files are stored.

Have fun!
