Base for solving problems in AoC 2025

[https://adventofcode.com/2025/about](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about)

This is not the most optimal way to solve these types of problems. But for us Spring Boot lovers,
this is a basic framework to implement and run the solutions via a Web UI

To use this, create a fork, or copy the files locally.
Set the base location in the application.yml file to a place where your input files are stored.

Edit the solution files to provide your solution to part 1 and part 2 based on your input.

Have fun!
